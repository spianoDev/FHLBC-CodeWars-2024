# Given a board of NxN, distributed with tiles labeled 0 to NÂ² - 1(inclusive):
#
# A solved grid will have the tiles in order of label, left to right, top to bottom.
#
# Return true if the board state is currently solved, and false if the board state is unsolved.
#
# Input will always be a square 2d array.
#
# For example, a 2x2 solved grid:
#
# [ [0, 1],
#   [2, 3] ]
# A 2x2 unsolved grid:
#
# [ [2, 1],
#   [0, 3] ]

        if pair[0] == count and pair[1] == (count + 1):
            count += 2
        else:
            print('false')
            return False
